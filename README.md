# Static-Routing
Static routes are created in global config mode, and require a destination prefix and a way to get there.
#For example:
let's say that our router's Serial 1/1 interface, with an IP address of 192.168. 1.5/30, has a point-to-point link to another router's Serial 2/2
with IP address 192.168. 1.6/30.
